# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- I went ahead and added some padding to the title and description in the header page to prevent the cafe picture from overlapping on smaller screens.
  (I didn't see anywhere in the brief, nor the video resources, that mentioned handling this.)
- Adding in the customized version of the checkbox for the reservation page once I have a bit more practice on how implement it.
- Possibly adding some stylized borders around the menu cards.
